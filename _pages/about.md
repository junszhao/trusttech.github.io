I am an experience academic researcher working on the interaction of human and AI systems. 

My current research focuses on investigating the impact of algorithmic systems on our everyday life, especially for families and young children. For this, I take a human-centric approach, using a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods, to understand and design for users' needs. 

Currently, I lead the Oxford Child-Centred AI (OxCCAI) initiative. We explore a range of research challenges related to:

- Designing responsible AI technologies for children

- Unpacking the impact of AI on children

- Facilitating the development of more informed child-specific AI regulatory frameworks.
